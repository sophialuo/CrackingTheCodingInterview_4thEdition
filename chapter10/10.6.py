#Given a two dimensional graph with points on it, 
#find a line which passes the most number of points


#between every pair of points, calculate the slope and 
#y-intercept of the line formed. all lines that lie on the
#same line will share the same slope and y-intercept so
#we only need to keep track of the slope and y-intercept 
#that are most common

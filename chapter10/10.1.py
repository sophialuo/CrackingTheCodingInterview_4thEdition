#10.1
#You have a basketball hoop and someone says that
#you can play 1 of 2 games
#Game #1: you get one shot to make the hoop
#Game #2: you get three shots and you have to make
#       2 of 3 shots
#if p is the probability of making a particular shot
#for which values of p should you pick one game or
#the other


#P(win game 1) = p
#P(win game 2) = 3*p*p*(1-p) + p*p*p -- 2 or 3 out of 3 shots
#play game2 if P(win game 2) > P(win game 1)
#  3*p*p*(1-p) + p*p*p > p  =>  p > 0.5
